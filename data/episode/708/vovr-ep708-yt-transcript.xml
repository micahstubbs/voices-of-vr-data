<text start="11.07" dur="6.7">
hello my name is Kent Bye and welcome to the Voices of VR podcast. So I had a
</text>
<text start="17.77" dur="5.009">
chance to go to Indiecade after Magic Leap LEAPcon and Indiecade is this
</text>
<text start="22.779" dur="3.721">
international festival of play it&#39;s featuring all these independent games
</text>
<text start="26.5" dur="4.5">
and they&#39;re really trying to figure out the innovations and gameplay and so it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="31" dur="3.809">
a little bit of a leading indicator of what is to come when it comes to these
</text>
<text start="34.809" dur="4.17">
immersive and interactive experiences so they had about five different VR
</text>
<text start="38.979" dur="3.33">
experiences that were doing different experimental things a couple of
</text>
<text start="42.309" dur="4.23">
augmented reality experiences but also games that were just you moving your
</text>
<text start="46.539" dur="4.44">
body through space so a game that is embedded within a context we are moving
</text>
<text start="50.979" dur="3.93">
around in a space and it&#39;s also games that are starting to change the context
</text>
<text start="54.909" dur="4.621">
of what is around you and looking at these larger systems and so I had a
</text>
<text start="59.53" dur="4.62">
chance to talk to the festival director Sam Roberts and he&#39;s a curator he&#39;s in
</text>
<text start="64.15" dur="3.54">
charge of looking at what is new what&#39;s different what is really innovating in
</text>
<text start="67.69" dur="3.63">
the realm of game play and he&#39;s been doing that for about 11 years now so I
</text>
<text start="71.32" dur="3.18">
had a chance to talk to Sam Roberts about indicate some of the trends that
</text>
<text start="74.5" dur="4.65">
he&#39;s seeing as well as what he sees the future of play as so that&#39;s what we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="79.15" dur="3.6">
covering on today&#39;s episode a little it&#39;s a severe podcast so this interview
</text>
<text start="82.75" dur="4.59">
with Sam happened on Saturday October 13th 2018 at the indicate conference in
</text>
<text start="87.34" dur="5.49">
Santa Monica California so with that let&#39;s go ahead and dive right in
</text>
<text start="92.83" dur="3.99">
I&#39;m Sam Roberts and I&#39;m the festival director for IndieCade which means I
</text>
<text start="96.82" dur="4.5">
generally am in charge of our content. IndieCade is the International Festival of
</text>
<text start="101.32" dur="5.01">
play so what that means is we are looking for play and playful experiences
</text>
<text start="106.33" dur="4.71">
from all over the world in entertainment and non entertainment mediums and we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="111.04" dur="4.47">
looking for innovation and we want to bring as broad an example of what that
</text>
<text start="115.51" dur="4.89">
is together at our festival every year because I think that most of them oh
</text>
<text start="120.4" dur="4.86">
really brilliant innovations happen from mashing up these people with different
</text>
<text start="125.26" dur="2.76">
skills and different interests and different things that they&#39;re doing
</text>
<text start="128.02" dur="5.579">
showing video game developers amazing V are showing VR developers like big games
</text>
<text start="133.599" dur="4.081">
and performance games connecting that with the table game in the RPG community
</text>
<text start="137.68" dur="3.24">
and getting all this feedback so that&#39;s sort of like what we&#39;re about and what
</text>
<text start="140.92" dur="3.12">we do. Stephanie Barish is the CEO started In-</text>
<text start="144.04" dur="5.479">
dieCade in the mid 2000s because she had been working with a lot of sort of like
</text>
<text start="149.519" dur="5.561">
new-age animation students who were making not like animated short films but
</text>
<text start="155.08" dur="4.409">
not video games right like interactive pieces of digital art and they didn&#39;t
</text>
<text start="159.489" dur="3.72">
have a home for them and she was like this stuff should have a home and she
</text>
<text start="163.209" dur="6.271">
was friends with Tracy Fullerton. Tracy made a game at that time called The
</text>
<text start="169.48" dur="5.569">
Night Journey which is a video game collaboration with Bill Viola who&#39;s a
</text>
<text start="175.049" dur="5.051">
film video artist and so it&#39;s like essentially like a museum video art
</text>
<text start="180.1" dur="4.169">
exhibit that you could play on the PlayStation Tracy recently everyone&#39;s
</text>
<text start="184.269" dur="3.541">
been talking about it cuz she made Walden, A Game so Tracy connected
</text>
<text start="187.81" dur="4.11">
Stephanie with Celia Pearce and myself who from different directions had been
</text>
<text start="191.92" dur="6.21">
involved in curating play video game and play like experiences in other venues
</text>
<text start="198.13" dur="3.74">
and Stefanie got in touch with us we all started talking and working together and
</text>
<text start="201.87" dur="6.58">
we did a firsthand curated exhibit at e3 in 2007 and then had our first Festival
</text>
<text start="208.45" dur="4.47">
in 2008 in Seattle and then have had them every year here in Los Angeles
</text>
<text start="212.92" dur="6.149">
since then Wow yeah so I&#39;m really fascinated by this concept of how ideas
</text>
<text start="219.069" dur="4.681">
and new concepts get born and how they get disseminated out covering virtual
</text>
<text start="223.75" dur="3.329">
reality you know it&#39;s a technology that goes back to the 60s and then the 90s
</text>
<text start="227.079" dur="4.41">
it&#39;s a big push and then it goes into the bespoke and enterprise applications
</text>
<text start="231.489" dur="4.231">
and then eventually there&#39;s consumer applications that crosses the chasm into
</text>
<text start="235.72" dur="4.169">
the mainstream and it feels like that there&#39;s academic ideas and concepts that
</text>
<text start="239.889" dur="3.72">
then those students create a project and then those projects are here indicate
</text>
<text start="243.609" dur="4.141">
and then some of those projects and ideas take root and then they are the
</text>
<text start="247.75" dur="3.329">
next wave of what the future is holding so I&#39;m just curious I hear how you&#39;ve
</text>
<text start="251.079" dur="4.261">
seen that play out yeah I mean that is how it plays out I think you and I are
</text>
<text start="255.34" dur="3.42">
in sync on how we think that works but I think you know there&#39;s hard examples
</text>
<text start="258.76" dur="5.04">
like we showed use of force seven years ago right so we showed it
</text>
<text start="263.8" dur="5.76">
before there was a dev oculus kit we were using the technology from Mark
</text>
<text start="269.56" dur="4.68">
Bolas&#39;s VR lab that is basically the grandfather of the Oculus technology.
</text>
<text start="274.24" dur="5.64">
Nonny came and showed the piece she won an award and then last night Nonny was
</text>
<text start="279.88" dur="5.28">
just running around as Nonny and like great to see her but you know this year
</text>
<text start="285.16" dur="7.47">
we have five 360 basically VR playful light interaction experiences that are
</text>
<text start="292.63" dur="3.75">
documentary in about serious topics we have VR games throughout the festival
</text>
<text start="296.38" dur="4.17">
you know it&#39;s all over and people are exploring political meaning or just pure
</text>
<text start="300.55" dur="3.87">
entertainment and a bunch of other stuff in that space now and I get to see that
</text>
<text start="304.42" dur="4.47">
sort of growing happen early on in the festival we started introducing big
</text>
<text start="308.89" dur="4.35">
games and tabletop games and then over the past few years like a lot of the
</text>
<text start="313.24" dur="4.5">
lessons from like tabletop role-playing have been filtering through in my eyes
</text>
<text start="317.74" dur="3.39">
what I see is innovative video game design so you see a lot more focus on
</text>
<text start="321.13" dur="3.87">
like what role am i asking the player to take on and like how do we make games
</text>
<text start="325" dur="4.26">
that through roleplay create empathy or knowledge or things like that right and
</text>
<text start="329.26" dur="3.15">
like that exploration is super interesting to me and I feel like I can
</text>
<text start="332.41" dur="3.51">
track it some of the early tabletop role-playing games we showed are things
</text>
<text start="335.92" dur="4.74">
like so Liam Burke made this wonderful game this is a tabletop role-playing
</text>
<text start="340.66" dur="5.49">
game about when Western powers take their ships and cross oceans and then
</text>
<text start="346.15" dur="3.96">
they colonize right so he made this game about colonialization where you were
</text>
<text start="350.11" dur="3.9">
either the colonizer or those being colonized and it&#39;s basically a good
</text>
<text start="354.01" dur="3.75">
tabletop game where you negotiate the rules and the rules are about the
</text>
<text start="357.76" dur="4.05">
colonizers to establish rules but if they set down too many rules they spark
</text>
<text start="361.81" dur="4.98">
rebellion which nobody actually wants and the colonized want the rules to be
</text>
<text start="366.79" dur="3.81">
as not interfering with their way of life is possible but would rather not
</text>
<text start="370.6" dur="4.8">
actually have armed rebellion and have everybody die and like that idea that
</text>
<text start="375.4" dur="5.58">
you could explore these topics in dialectic through roleplay is something
</text>
<text start="380.98" dur="2.659">
that then I have seen again and again and again and video
</text>
<text start="383.639" dur="3.12">
games in the year since then it&#39;s and they all saw Liam&#39;s working like that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="386.759" dur="3.9">
what we&#39;re doing but I do feel like bringing people together and thinking in
</text>
<text start="390.659" dur="3.181">
that way right bring in a dev who&#39;s just making a game that&#39;s being fun and I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="393.84" dur="3.24">
gonna look over and see again that doesn&#39;t look anything like his game but
</text>
<text start="397.08" dur="3.239">
is doing something fundamentally different and getting excited about that
</text>
<text start="400.319" dur="3.331">
and excited about how those mechanics work or how they&#39;re looking at playing
</text>
<text start="403.65" dur="6.09">
another way and then exploring it Pietro Riva who&#39;s an Italian developer from
</text>
<text start="409.74" dur="3.479">
Milan has been coming to the festival for six years now this is his third
</text>
<text start="413.219" dur="4.051">
project that we&#39;ve shown but the first project of his was like a video game it
</text>
<text start="417.27" dur="3.72">
was a good video game it&#39;s really beautiful and fun they&#39;re really very
</text>
<text start="420.99" dur="5.07">
specific like point of view and aesthetic but this year pitch was game
</text>
<text start="426.06" dur="6.99">
is a silent auction for 30 people where his whole goal is like he got to go to
</text>
<text start="433.05" dur="4.47">
this auction it was like this is like a human experience that is super engaging
</text>
<text start="437.52" dur="6.63">
but basically almost no one gets ever so I want to make a game where you can have
</text>
<text start="444.15" dur="4.41">
a really pretty real version of this experience and so it&#39;s this auction of
</text>
<text start="448.56" dur="5.279">
36 magical items at Sotheby&#39;s and you get assigned money and a roll you get
</text>
<text start="453.839" dur="3.841">
bonus points for making certain things happen and then this big emergent like
</text>
<text start="457.68" dur="3.75">
playful experience happens it&#39;s really awesome and cool you need to watch that
</text>
<text start="461.43" dur="3.509">
kind of evolution and our very first festival one of the amazing things that
</text>
<text start="464.939" dur="4.621">
happen is devs from different parts of the world met each other and started a
</text>
<text start="469.56" dur="3.719">
career-long collaboration and stuff like that happens to you know somebody who&#39;s
</text>
<text start="473.279" dur="3.51">
like exploring essentially like experimental animation and somebody
</text>
<text start="476.789" dur="5.4">
who&#39;s interested in like obsessively in like physical mechanics of play Doug
</text>
<text start="482.189" dur="4.35">
Wilson and Nils Deneken came together at that festival and like fell in creative
</text>
<text start="486.539" dur="3.961">
love and like made games together for like six years you know so I feel like
</text>
<text start="490.5" dur="4.289">
you need to do this thing where you really cast the doors open and you make
</text>
<text start="494.789" dur="4.171">
an open space and you invite in everything that seems interesting then
</text>
<text start="498.96" dur="6.449">
you let that miscegenation happen and like it&#39;s not necessarily fast and media
</text>
<text start="505.409" dur="4.891">
but it creates this boiling pot of like exciting ideas that people start to pull
</text>
<text start="510.3" dur="2.479">out and experiment with and go away and make</text>
<text start="512.779" dur="5.67">
and like that is though so much of why we do this and I think I would like to
</text>
<text start="518.449" dur="4.32">
think we&#39;re successful at it I see it actually happen I guess yeah back in
</text>
<text start="522.769" dur="3.75">
2016 I had a chance to go to the artificial intelligence and interactive
</text>
<text start="526.519" dur="3.99">
and design and entertainment aid conference and saw number of pieces
</text>
<text start="530.509" dur="4.77">
there bad news also prom week I saw when I went home and then there&#39;s another one
</text>
<text start="535.279" dur="7.05">
about Shakespeare Elsinore so this so that there is artificial intelligence
</text>
<text start="542.329" dur="4.8">
and what the UC Santa Cruz Expressive Intelligence Studio by Michael Mateas is
</text>
<text start="547.129" dur="2.94">
working on and so I&#39;m just curious from your perspective like what is happening
</text>
<text start="550.069" dur="5.07">
in the realm of artificial intelligence and gaming here at indicate yes so this
</text>
<text start="555.139" dur="3.39">
year we don&#39;t have a ton of AI driven stuff but I actually think there&#39;s a
</text>
<text start="558.529" dur="3.391">
really interesting thing that people tend to gloss over and actually I like
</text>
<text start="561.92" dur="4.349">
so tender which is an AR experience upstairs is leveraging a bunch of AI
</text>
<text start="566.269" dur="4.411">
tools yeah that was at Sundance this past year yeah so there&#39;s also there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="570.68" dur="3.389">
this interesting divide now that people talk a lot about between artificial
</text>
<text start="574.069" dur="4.02">
intelligence and augmented intelligence and augmented intelligence has tools
</text>
<text start="578.089" dur="6.48">
that do parts of the work so that we can be better at our jobs things that like
</text>
<text start="584.569" dur="3.901">
survey a hundred thousand options and run a bunch of samples on that
</text>
<text start="588.47" dur="3.03">
population and then say these are your best options so then I as a human design
</text>
<text start="591.5" dur="3.42">
or have like 10 things to look at it sent 10,000 things that stuff helps but
</text>
<text start="594.92" dur="2.88">
so something that actually fits into those spaces that&#39;s doing some of the
</text>
<text start="597.8" dur="3.509">
work a I does that&#39;s doing some of the work that augment intelligence does is
</text>
<text start="601.309" dur="4.111">
procedure ality and independent game developers have been obsessed with
</text>
<text start="605.42" dur="4.8">
procedure ality and the idea of the roguelike for like six years now I mean
</text>
<text start="610.22" dur="4.049">
for a long time right but it was a micro community for a long time basically just
</text>
<text start="614.269" dur="3.18">people making roguelikes and lovers of nethack</text>
<text start="617.449" dur="3.301">
and that sort of blew up six to eight years ago and you&#39;re seeing it
</text>
<text start="620.75" dur="4.709">
everywhere but there&#39;s a ton of AI that goes into that stuff so a lot of these
</text>
<text start="625.459" dur="3.6">
procedural systems learn from the player right this is stuff that like Jenova
</text>
<text start="629.059" dur="4.47">
Chen also explored and flow right dynamic difficulty adjustment taking
</text>
<text start="633.529" dur="4.5">
player inputs and not just having a hard-coded output that goes with that
</text>
<text start="638.029" dur="5.191">
but having a systemic possibly changing systemic response to things that players
</text>
<text start="643.22" dur="4.1">
do based on their ongoing inputs and I see a lot of exploration of that
</text>
<text start="647.32" dur="4.17">
an exploration of well if this was a game where the humans had more control
</text>
<text start="651.49" dur="3.9">
they would slowly shape it into what they&#39;re interested in over time so how
</text>
<text start="655.39" dur="4.53">
do we make systems that are learning from what they&#39;re doing and help shape
</text>
<text start="659.92" dur="2.97">
the game into the game experience that they want over time so that&#39;s where I
</text>
<text start="662.89" dur="3.9">
see that stuff happening now and that is being leveraged draw can wait upstairs
</text>
<text start="666.79" dur="4.2">
which is a puzzle game is leveraging some like human learning systems for its
</text>
<text start="670.99" dur="6.24">
design there&#39;s some other procedural stuff exposure has some AI in it and
</text>
<text start="677.23" dur="4.47">
it&#39;s like a camouflage multiplayer hiding hunting game yeah off the top of
</text>
<text start="681.7" dur="4.11">
my head that&#39;s what I got for you yeah well another trend that I&#39;m seeing I
</text>
<text start="685.81" dur="4.529">
just did a quick walk around but multimodal experiences that are bringing
</text>
<text start="690.339" dur="2.911">
in many different senses I think obviously virtual reality
</text>
<text start="693.25" dur="3.06">
augmented reality starting to do that but playing with sound playing with
</text>
<text start="696.31" dur="3.36">
optics perhaps and just curious to hear from your perspective of over the last
</text>
<text start="699.67" dur="4.859">
10 or 11 years how you&#39;ve seen this immersive or embodied or multimodal
</text>
<text start="704.529" dur="4.051">
gameplay command so this is something that I personally am very very excited
</text>
<text start="708.58" dur="3.15">
about it it might be the reason that I try to shove all these people together
</text>
<text start="711.73" dur="4.14">
and have them explore things I&#39;ve been interested in transmedia for long time
</text>
<text start="715.87" dur="5.3">
multimedia yada yada we all say these words but basically like we settled
</text>
<text start="721.17" dur="5.65">
culturally for a fair amount of time into image and text as like how we
</text>
<text start="726.82" dur="5.49">
deliver to content and video games which have been the torchbearers of games for
</text>
<text start="732.31" dur="5.16">
quite some time now really even leaned off of sound but like when it comes to
</text>
<text start="737.47" dur="2.9">
interactivity and responsility Sam is actually one of the most like
</text>
<text start="740.37" dur="6.1">
leverageable human senses like we are extremely responsive to sound and we
</text>
<text start="746.47" dur="4.26">
like making sounds and we can play sounds and over the past six eight years
</text>
<text start="750.73" dur="3.479">
you&#39;ve just started to slowly see people like taking stabs at that part that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="754.209" dur="4.831">
related to 360 sound the way you can layout sound and game engines now and
</text>
<text start="759.04" dur="3.69">
some of that stuff but like so seven years ago or five years ago we showed a
</text>
<text start="762.73" dur="8.04">
thing called Papa sangre where basically the screen is dark it is a 3d like you
</text>
<text start="770.77" dur="5.64">
move through 3d space but you play it by listening all of the feedback that tells
</text>
<text start="776.41" dur="2.64">
you what you&#39;re doing the game comes from audio you take a step
</text>
<text start="779.05" dur="2.969">
and you hear the footstep and how it echoes and you have to place walls and
</text>
<text start="782.019" dur="3.421">
figure out where their openings and here the monster and here&#39;s looking for and
</text>
<text start="785.44" dur="4.25">
you move throughout the entire space just by moving right so I think that we
</text>
<text start="789.69" dur="4.3">
to go to actually beginning your answer what I saw 10 years ago is people saying
</text>
<text start="793.99" dur="2.73">aha there are angles to attack games that</text>
<text start="796.72" dur="4.53">
we&#39;re not attacking it by and what I&#39;m starting to see now which I think is the
</text>
<text start="801.25" dur="4.47">
step from beyond that is how do we integrate multiples of these angles into
</text>
<text start="805.72" dur="5.25">
single experiences how do we not just deliver an oral experience or a visual
</text>
<text start="810.97" dur="4.08">
experience or a textual experience or a taste experience or a touch experience
</text>
<text start="815.05" dur="5.909">
but how do we like leverage audio and touch and visuals you know in the
</text>
<text start="820.959" dur="4.32">
layered way or in a separated way to build something that is more complete
</text>
<text start="825.279" dur="3.961">
and fills the world around you more which is how I get to the word you used
</text>
<text start="829.24" dur="4.74">
immersive right I think this is actually one of the real keys to immersion is
</text>
<text start="833.98" dur="5.46">
that like when we can tap as many of the inputs into the human system as possible
</text>
<text start="839.44" dur="4.11">
with what we&#39;re trying to express it&#39;s much easier to immerse that human being
</text>
<text start="843.55" dur="4.83">
in an experience right so like this wasn&#39;t an indie game I had a student two
</text>
<text start="848.38" dur="4.89">
years ago do a thesis project it was a VR meditation experience put on the VR
</text>
<text start="853.27" dur="5.37">
helmet there&#39;s the sound you&#39;re in this beautiful forest but then he also bought
</text>
<text start="858.64" dur="4.439">
essence of pine and a faint like that&#39;s it right
</text>
<text start="863.079" dur="4.021">
but like you would sit down on this cushion and you&#39;d be in this forest and
</text>
<text start="867.1" dur="4.26">
you could see things and you could hear the forest and then a pine scented
</text>
<text start="871.36" dur="4.62">
breeze blew across you and like bam it helped you jump right into that space
</text>
<text start="875.98" dur="4.53">
right it&#39;s small it&#39;s not that much but like why aren&#39;t we doing that with more
</text>
<text start="880.51" dur="4.56">
things and then I think you see things like tale of Ord which is upstairs which
</text>
<text start="885.07" dur="4.709">
is essentially a mail order Arg you like sign up and they mail you clues and you
</text>
<text start="889.779" dur="3.87">
solve them on the internet right and so much that is text-based but it is as you
</text>
<text start="893.649" dur="3.541">
say multimodal it&#39;s jumping between like I&#39;m reading stuff and solving a hard
</text>
<text start="897.19" dur="3.81">
puzzle here then I&#39;m like doing a different kind of like internet
</text>
<text start="901" dur="4.41">
breadcrumb trail following to solve a different kind of puzzle and again like
</text>
<text start="905.41" dur="5.22">
by leveraging different ways of interacting with the thing a game is
</text>
<text start="910.63" dur="3.69">
creating a much larger immersive space and so I guess that goes back to also
</text>
<text start="914.32" dur="3.42">
than what I would say in the beginning is that helping all of these developers
</text>
<text start="917.74" dur="5.789">
find different ways to attack human interaction human experience sensory
</text>
<text start="923.529" dur="3.571">
inputs and like think about combining those and leveraging them together are
</text>
<text start="927.1" dur="4.65">
we pushing towards this sort of more immersive future and for me like this
</text>
<text start="931.75" dur="5.52">
sort of like I am excited about quite a renaissance but an explosion of playful
</text>
<text start="937.27" dur="4.86">
experience that I think is coming over the next 10 20 30 years yeah one of the
</text>
<text start="942.13" dur="4.59">
big open questions I have for VR is is there an experience or a mark that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="946.72" dur="5.13">
able to take the theoretical concepts from game design add in the cinematic
</text>
<text start="951.85" dur="4.71">
storytelling from film and then also put in the different embodied aspects of
</text>
<text start="956.56" dur="3.6">
what it means to be present from Eastern philosophies Chinese philosophies and
</text>
<text start="960.16" dur="4.32">
other dynamics of how do you hack the sensorimotor contingencies and so you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="964.48" dur="4.89">
adding gaming with film with embodiment and that I feel like that virtuality an
</text>
<text start="969.37" dur="3.48">
augmented reality are really encompassing that but from you as you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="972.85" dur="4.26">
curating all of the stuff on just wondering if you use any type of
</text>
<text start="977.11" dur="4.74">
specific game design theory if there&#39;s like ones that are really popular or if
</text>
<text start="981.85" dur="3.63">
it&#39;s kind of an open question as to how to translate all these things into a
</text>
<text start="985.48" dur="2.49">
design framework iving lots of people have different
</text>
<text start="987.97" dur="5.01">
ideas actually as a curator I try to very explicitly as a curator not have
</text>
<text start="992.98" dur="3.599">
one that I think is right I want to be proven wrong and again I want to have
</text>
<text start="996.579" dur="4.38">
you and you who think fundamentally different about this talk to each other
</text>
<text start="1000.959" dur="5.311">
and start to maybe solve for what&#39;s deeper the thing that will stop VR from
</text>
<text start="1006.27" dur="6.12">
establishing a set of best design practices and pieces of knowledge about
</text>
<text start="1012.39" dur="4.65">
how you communicate and leverage the affordances of the medium is if it
</text>
<text start="1017.04" dur="5.85">
continues to be a medium in flux now once a medium can continue to change
</text>
<text start="1022.89" dur="2.699">
once you start to establish these affordances and those affordances can
</text>
<text start="1025.589" dur="5.161">
change look at film but you know you need something that sort of is pretty
</text>
<text start="1030.75" dur="5.85">
settled before you really start to establish a lot of those like these are
</text>
<text start="1036.6" dur="2.47">
best practices for the for dances this is how we manipulate
</text>
<text start="1039.07" dur="3.69">
film editing to make you cry this is when we put the sound on the cut you
</text>
<text start="1042.76" dur="3.63">
know that kind of stuff like the film does and game design has its own stuff
</text>
<text start="1046.39" dur="6.21">
like that games a little odd because it is both got sort of the play medium but
</text>
<text start="1052.6" dur="3.87">
it has a ton of different technological platforms so each of those has their own
</text>
<text start="1056.47" dur="5.6">
affordances this is actually where VR is I think that until there is a standard
</text>
<text start="1062.07" dur="6.49">
interaction paradigm around VR that a lot of these best practices and this is
</text>
<text start="1068.56" dur="5.07">
how we use this medium to tell stories are gonna stay pretty divergent right so
</text>
<text start="1073.63" dur="5.37">
like when I advise students working in the space I push them towards as much
</text>
<text start="1079" dur="4.2">
gaze interaction and his little other interaction as possible because it to me
</text>
<text start="1083.2" dur="4.35">
is the universal interaction point right now in VR like if you&#39;re doing VR you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="1087.55" dur="5.01">
looking at things so let&#39;s start from there and solve that stuff which likely
</text>
<text start="1092.56" dur="5.91">
isn&#39;t too change whereas like I don&#39;t know if there will be a settled solution
</text>
<text start="1098.47" dur="7.2">
around gestural interface controllers speech like all of these things are
</text>
<text start="1105.67" dur="5.79">
possible and being used and none of them seems like anyone knows what it will be
</text>
<text start="1111.46" dur="4.23">
versus one of the others and like you can learn a lot by exploring that stuff
</text>
<text start="1115.69" dur="3.99">
but you&#39;re not going to necessarily be establishing best practices because in
</text>
<text start="1119.68" dur="5.49">
six months everybody might be like oh we figured out it&#39;s totally stupid to have
</text>
<text start="1125.17" dur="5.13">
a wand or everyone be like oh they figured it out everything we&#39;ll have a
</text>
<text start="1130.3" dur="5.61">
wand now you know and you don&#39;t really know until that kind of happens I&#39;m part
</text>
<text start="1135.91" dur="3">
of figuring out whether it&#39;ll be that or not is experimenting with and playing
</text>
<text start="1138.91" dur="3.45">
with those things which we&#39;ll watch but if I&#39;m looking for where people are
</text>
<text start="1142.36" dur="5.12">
making steps towards what you&#39;re asking about it&#39;s people who are exploring
</text>
<text start="1147.48" dur="4.57">
mostly gaze directed in their face right now well the way that I think about it
</text>
<text start="1152.05" dur="4.29">
as an experiential journalist who is paying attention to my own direct
</text>
<text start="1156.34" dur="3">
experience is my phenomenology I&#39;m seeing a bunch of stuff and I&#39;m trying
</text>
<text start="1159.34" dur="3.12">
to make sense of it and then talk to the craters and so I have to use some sort
</text>
<text start="1162.46" dur="4.62">
of mental map and model to do that but any model is gonna be if I&#39;d look to
</text>
<text start="1167.08" dur="3.41">
mathematics of girdles and completeness theorem see basically
</text>
<text start="1170.49" dur="4.23">
mathematically that any consistent set of rules is gonna be incomplete and so
</text>
<text start="1174.72" dur="3.51">
there&#39;s not gonna be one universal framework to cover everything and so I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="1178.23" dur="3.69">
taking more of like what is the one that I&#39;m gonna personally use but also see
</text>
<text start="1181.92" dur="3.63">
that there&#39;s other philosophies other approaches that may never be possible to
</text>
<text start="1185.55" dur="3.3">
fully integrate all those but anytime you have qualitative experiences there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="1188.85" dur="3.18">
an infinite number of way you can slice and dice that and so the way that I do
</text>
<text start="1192.03" dur="3.029">
it personally is through the four elements so the fire element being
</text>
<text start="1195.059" dur="3.901">
active presence of how much agency and will you&#39;re directing into the
</text>
<text start="1198.96" dur="4.56">
experience to either explore or to chase your curiosity and then the air element
</text>
<text start="1203.52" dur="3.659">
being the mental and social presence where you&#39;re you&#39;re making choices or
</text>
<text start="1207.179" dur="3">
you&#39;re making sense of the world are you&#39;re solving puzzles and so you have
</text>
<text start="1210.179" dur="3.421">
making choices and taking action of the expressing your energy outwards like
</text>
<text start="1213.6" dur="4.14">
more the young and then the more yen of both the water and earth which is the
</text>
<text start="1217.74" dur="3.18">
emotional presence as well as the embodied presence and so how are these
</text>
<text start="1220.92" dur="3.84">
things engaging your emotions through narrative and story and plot and music
</text>
<text start="1224.76" dur="4.86">
and cycles but also your sensory motor contingencies of what kind of haptic sin
</text>
<text start="1229.62" dur="3.51">
what&#39;s the sound with the visuals and what&#39;s that make your body feel like and
</text>
<text start="1233.13" dur="3.84">
so it feels like to me that&#39;s the essence of how I at least make sense of
</text>
<text start="1236.97" dur="2.37">
things and I don&#39;t know if you have any thoughts from well I have heard this
</text>
<text start="1239.34" dur="3.6">
before cuz I heard you on Noah&#39;s show I really actually loved that framework I
</text>
<text start="1242.94" dur="2.67">
think it&#39;s a really interesting way to break that media and also I think lets
</text>
<text start="1245.61" dur="3.21">
me answer your first question a little better if I take a step back
</text>
<text start="1248.82" dur="5.989">
particularly from any medium or platform I analyze everything we get around
</text>
<text start="1254.809" dur="6.131">
interaction paradigm because we are a play festival for play experiences I am
</text>
<text start="1260.94" dur="5.73">
always asking what do I do and what happens when I do it and how do I do and
</text>
<text start="1266.67" dur="4.68">
that&#39;s really all I want to know that&#39;s where I start looking at an interactive
</text>
<text start="1271.35" dur="5.19">
old piece and that is definitely because I&#39;m a game designer as you say it is not
</text>
<text start="1276.54" dur="3.18">
going to work for everything and it&#39;s not Universal and it&#39;s not that
</text>
<text start="1279.72" dur="3.06">
everybody has to do that but like that is how I start with looking at things
</text>
<text start="1282.78" dur="7.29">
and that sort of puts me just like on a slice of your pie although it could also
</text>
<text start="1290.07" dur="3.54">
spread across your pie right depending on whether like my feedback is
</text>
<text start="1293.61" dur="3.87">
leveraging your emotionality or your physical presence and whether the way
</text>
<text start="1297.48" dur="5.73">
you act in is about sort of like taking a very active pushing role or if you are
</text>
<text start="1303.21" dur="2.32">
taking a passive offensive role I&#39;m like I you know like
</text>
<text start="1305.53" dur="5.7">
some games the point is to conquer things or to win or to move into
</text>
<text start="1311.23" dur="3.63">
territory and that&#39;s all active but some games are super defensive like in a
</text>
<text start="1314.86" dur="5.1">
classic game since like Arkanoid is the game where all you&#39;re really doing is
</text>
<text start="1319.96" dur="4.47">
responding in the situation and trying to keep it functional and then stuff
</text>
<text start="1324.43" dur="2.7">
goes in-between those and then likewise some games are giving me feedback
</text>
<text start="1327.13" dur="4.56">
through story and audio and visuals that in my mind are mapping to what you
</text>
<text start="1331.69" dur="2.91">
talked about with water they&#39;re trying to leverage my emotional presence that
</text>
<text start="1334.6" dur="3.75">
are saying you did a thing and I&#39;m gonna reward you or feedback by feeding into
</text>
<text start="1338.35" dur="4.11">
that but then they&#39;re like I mean there are less well but they&#39;re not less of
</text>
<text start="1342.46" dur="3.99">
these you know there&#39;s like tag which actually is very much a game that is
</text>
<text start="1346.45" dur="4.41">
giving its feedback and interaction through physicality and asking you to be
</text>
<text start="1350.86" dur="3.54">
embodied in the space there&#39;s LARPing there&#39;s a bunch of stuff that sort of
</text>
<text start="1354.4" dur="4.17">
falls in that category or even if you look at like the stupid video game
</text>
<text start="1358.57" dur="4.68">
controllers from late 90s early 2000s and have Rumble in them and I don&#39;t know
</text>
<text start="1363.25" dur="3.6">
if you&#39;ve ever played the pain station or know what it is but it&#39;s a video game
</text>
<text start="1366.85" dur="6.18">
that delivers electric shocks when you fail it&#39;s horrifying right but so I I
</text>
<text start="1373.03" dur="4.77">
like the paradigm you talking about because it acknowledges the breadth of
</text>
<text start="1377.8" dur="3.39">
the space there&#39;s so many points of entry to that which is what I think is
</text>
<text start="1381.19" dur="2.79">
really interesting about it and then I generally agree with you about the
</text>
<text start="1383.98" dur="5.1">
utility of having a framework because once you have a framework you start to
</text>
<text start="1389.08" dur="3.99">
talk about things in a way where people can understand you yeah well what I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="1393.07" dur="3.3">
curious to hear from your perspective like what is on the bleeding edge of
</text>
<text start="1396.37" dur="2.91">
what&#39;s new or the trends that are happening when it comes to independent
</text>
<text start="1399.28" dur="7.35">
games so I do think that games that are becoming embedded in spaces is a lot of
</text>
<text start="1406.63" dur="3.72">
what&#39;s exciting and interesting right now this is why escape rooms are blowing
</text>
<text start="1410.35" dur="2.97">
up all over the country even if many of them are not really even all that
</text>
<text start="1413.32" dur="3.72">
exciting right it&#39;s like why go to this place and I play this game that sort of
</text>
<text start="1417.04" dur="3.48">
is like feeling like it&#39;s in the real world you know I&#39;ve been in an alternate
</text>
<text start="1420.52" dur="4.53">
reality games for a long time those are all about the bleed of the fiction into
</text>
<text start="1425.05" dur="4.64">
the world around us I love clack so radio hour which is upstairs which is an
</text>
<text start="1429.69" dur="4.68">
audio-only game that is embedded in a physical radio
</text>
<text start="1434.37" dur="4.86">
and you make your choices by spinning the dial like I&#39;m really interested in
</text>
<text start="1439.23" dur="5.939">
these play spaces that are transforming the world around us I have been for a
</text>
<text start="1445.169" dur="5.61">
long time I really love big games that give you sort of like a fictional
</text>
<text start="1450.779" dur="3.451">
framework and some sort of physical interaction and just by doing those
</text>
<text start="1454.23" dur="3.03">things it literally reshapes the space around</text>
<text start="1457.26" dur="4.47">
you into being or meaning something other than what it means you know that
</text>
<text start="1461.73" dur="5.88">
transformative power of the Magic Circle that I think is actually where tons of
</text>
<text start="1467.61" dur="4.89">
the most exciting work I see happening is happening and even in little ways
</text>
<text start="1472.5" dur="4.049">
people are throwing it in Drock and only that I mentioned upstairs as a thing
</text>
<text start="1476.549" dur="7.86">
where you can pull in steam reviews of the game instead of bricks right but
</text>
<text start="1484.409" dur="4.02">
what that&#39;s actually doing is saying I&#39;m gonna take all this commentary this word
</text>
<text start="1488.429" dur="4.38">
space of the internet that exists around this game I am playing and I&#39;m going to
</text>
<text start="1492.809" dur="5.97">
destroy and mash it like actually change the activity and lets you feel a ability
</text>
<text start="1498.779" dur="3.601">
to interact with that thing that is not interactable it transforms it those
</text>
<text start="1502.38" dur="3.87">
reviews become an obstacle in the game and you see that and that changes the
</text>
<text start="1506.25" dur="3">
way you feel about them like that game is not about doing all this stuff in a
</text>
<text start="1509.25" dur="4.22">
big way but has this little way in which it explores that I think and you know um
</text>
<text start="1513.47" dur="4.27">
phenomenology which is a vr experience we&#39;re showing upstairs I think very much
</text>
<text start="1517.74" dur="6.24">
about like how mood and sense and choice totally reshape spaces around you and
</text>
<text start="1523.98" dur="4.41">
let you experience them in these unique in different ways even if they are not
</text>
<text start="1528.39" dur="2.97">
always unique and different because you&#39;re bringing this different
</text>
<text start="1531.36" dur="5.069">
interpersonal framework to the space around you and yeah that is what super
</text>
<text start="1536.429" dur="4.051">
excites me right now and where I think a lot of the cutting edge of play
</text>
<text start="1540.48" dur="4.38">
experience is happening again there&#39;s a huge explosion in like ways to make
</text>
<text start="1544.86" dur="3">
these things all of a sudden right we have mobile phones I mean VR we have
</text>
<text start="1547.86" dur="4.83">
computers and we have consoles there&#39;s a board game Renaissance in America you
</text>
<text start="1552.69" dur="3.239">
can make so many different kinds of games and plug them into each other you
</text>
<text start="1555.929" dur="3.75">
can make a board game and add a speaker or another way of input to it that uses
</text>
<text start="1559.679" dur="4.11">
digital stuff you can like play with all of this stuff and everybody&#39;s doing all
</text>
<text start="1563.789" dur="4.481">
of that plane and it&#39;s wonderful but then where they&#39;re innovating in
</text>
<text start="1568.27" dur="6.22">
design weather innovating in building play is about using all of these new
</text>
<text start="1574.49" dur="4.14">
tools we have to leverage those interactions in this transformative way
</text>
<text start="1578.63" dur="3.45">
and I think again that is because and I&#39;ve talked about this with a bunch of
</text>
<text start="1582.08" dur="4.55">
people but I generally believe that like entertainment is headed towards
</text>
<text start="1586.63" dur="6.19">
experiential bespoke and immersive people want to change the world around
</text>
<text start="1592.82" dur="4.2">
them to have it feel different they want to have an experience not just see a
</text>
<text start="1597.02" dur="4.409">
story and they want to have something that is theirs and all of that suggests
</text>
<text start="1601.429" dur="4.62">
wanting immersive experiences just wanting play experiences that are
</text>
<text start="1606.049" dur="3">
different every time depending on what you bring to the experience and so
</text>
<text start="1609.049" dur="4.5">
that&#39;s sort of my ISM mm-hmm yeah I went to the spatial reality arts show last
</text>
<text start="1613.549" dur="2.76">
night and there are some augmented reality art pieces and what I found
</text>
<text start="1616.309" dur="4.591">
myself doing was that some of the pieces like Sutu&#39;s piece had like 11 pieces
</text>
<text start="1620.9" dur="3.81">
and you had to to put the pad down and lift it up and then it would add the
</text>
<text start="1624.71" dur="3">
next one and I found myself just going through and just lifting it up without
</text>
<text start="1627.71" dur="3.42">
really even looking at the art piece at first and then I would look at it with
</text>
<text start="1631.13" dur="3.45">
augmented reality animation and then I would see the whole context and like oh
</text>
<text start="1634.58" dur="4.56">
well maybe I should like actually take in what&#39;s there first before I transform
</text>
<text start="1639.14" dur="3.96">
it and then I started doing that and I noticed throughout today I was starting
</text>
<text start="1643.1" dur="3.449">
to like notice things more and just like paying attention and to my sensory
</text>
<text start="1646.549" dur="3.721">
experience and I feel like there&#39;s this almost like cultivation or training that
</text>
<text start="1650.27" dur="3.36">
we can start to create a magic circle in the world through augmented reality
</text>
<text start="1653.63" dur="4.14">
where we can start to overlay things that are magical but when we do that it
</text>
<text start="1657.77" dur="3.81">
allows us to pay attention to the entirety of the entire scene and see
</text>
<text start="1661.58" dur="3.03">
once we turn the augmented reality off now all of a sudden we&#39;ve got this
</text>
<text start="1664.61" dur="3.75">
cultivation of awareness to be able to be more aware of everything that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="1668.36" dur="3.87">
surrounding us I just fully agree I was nodding vigorously while you were
</text>
<text start="1672.23" dur="4.199">
speaking I argue with my wife all the time about some of this stuff she&#39;s a
</text>
<text start="1676.429" dur="4.021">
little bit of a Luddite I&#39;m not she&#39;s fine but you know I fundamentally
</text>
<text start="1680.45" dur="5.13">
believe that a power a lot of the power of expanding playful experience of
</text>
<text start="1685.58" dur="4.26">
augmented reality of digitizing the world around us is actually this ability
</text>
<text start="1689.84" dur="7.05">
to take us we human culture is its own powerful system with all of these inputs
</text>
<text start="1696.89" dur="4.05">
and we&#39;re super internally focused on it right now
</text>
<text start="1700.94" dur="4.319">
for a bunch of different reasons so much of it resides in screens that are here
</text>
<text start="1705.259" dur="3.54">
and all that kind of stuff and augmented reality to me is about taking all of
</text>
<text start="1708.799" dur="3.33">
this amazing stuff we&#39;ve done in these systems we&#39;ve developed for
</text>
<text start="1712.129" dur="3.99">
communicating for love for all of that stuff and helping to spread them back
</text>
<text start="1716.119" dur="4.77">
out into the physical world that we live in because we are very much physical
</text>
<text start="1720.889" dur="5.701">
creatures and changing actual spaces around us changing how we see and hear
</text>
<text start="1726.59" dur="3.809">
things just like you say makes us pay better attention to our bodies to the
</text>
<text start="1730.399" dur="4.291">
way we see true the way we hear we pay a special attention to the world again
</text>
<text start="1734.69" dur="4.589">
once it has been transformed in those ways and once we&#39;re engaged in the
</text>
<text start="1739.279" dur="4.38">
activity of doing a little bit of separation and vo that&#39;s augmented and
</text>
<text start="1743.659" dur="3.51">
that&#39;s not and this is you know I&#39;m like it is it&#39;s a thing that we can train
</text>
<text start="1747.169" dur="4.43">
inside ourselves I agree with you and I think that these experiences are deleted
</text>
<text start="1751.599" dur="5.05">
and so for you what do you want to experience either in VR or AR or any
</text>
<text start="1756.649" dur="5.16">
game that&#39;s out there so the thing that I want which I talked a lot of you about
</text>
<text start="1761.809" dur="4.5">
this and that nobody else wants it I want an augmented reality hiking
</text>
<text start="1766.309" dur="6.09">
experience that gives me essentially like poetic fantasies in the wilderness
</text>
<text start="1772.399" dur="5.01">
like that is what I want and you VR game AR developer who are listening to this
</text>
<text start="1777.409" dur="5.311">
podcast make it for me please I would like this for myself I think
</text>
<text start="1782.72" dur="4.079">
that I&#39;m already starting to see this as a trend if we think about like Joseph
</text>
<text start="1786.799" dur="3.24">
Campbell in the hero&#39;s journey it&#39;s like the young like you know you&#39;re really
</text>
<text start="1790.039" dur="3.21">
expressing your agency outward with the fire and air it&#39;s a lot about your will
</text>
<text start="1793.249" dur="4.53">
or your making choices taking action and that a lot of the strengths of augmented
</text>
<text start="1797.779" dur="4.08">
and virtual reality is this yen archetypal journey which is you being
</text>
<text start="1801.859" dur="3.841">
connected to yourself your body your emotions I&#39;m about to see everybody&#39;s
</text>
<text start="1805.7" dur="4.559">
sad as an experience I mean this is a for me a perfect embodiment of like
</text>
<text start="1810.259" dur="4.201">
these emotions of sadness and depression and shame that didn&#39;t necessarily fit
</text>
<text start="1814.46" dur="3.719">
into the hero&#39;s journey that we&#39;re used to and so I feel like there&#39;s that but
</text>
<text start="1818.179" dur="3.81">
it&#39;s also the more you in principles is how is the individual connected to the
</text>
<text start="1821.989" dur="3.81">
whole so as you have this concept of like what type of augmented reality
</text>
<text start="1825.799" dur="3.36">
experience is that as you&#39;re walking through a forest would allow you to
</text>
<text start="1829.159" dur="3.84">
connect to the larger story that&#39;s there I was talking to somebody who&#39;s tell me
</text>
<text start="1832.999" dur="3.381">
about native and track and the trackers they have to
</text>
<text start="1836.38" dur="4.02">
be able to notice disturbances so they have to see what&#39;s different
</text>
<text start="1840.4" dur="6.33">
so like whole space in a very real way because it&#39;s not oh I&#39;m looking for this
</text>
<text start="1846.73" dur="3.96">
specific thing to find it it&#39;s I&#39;m you know it&#39;s like those games we did his
</text>
<text start="1850.69" dur="2.82">
children was like what&#39;s different between the two pictures they&#39;ve got a
</text>
<text start="1853.51" dur="3.75">
picture and then they have to find what&#39;s wrong within it and that&#39;s really
</text>
<text start="1857.26" dur="5.82">
it&#39;s a different way of looking yes so that&#39;s it I want that too so if nobody
</text>
<text start="1863.08" dur="2.46">
built it I I might make something because I feel like that&#39;s something
</text>
<text start="1865.54" dur="5.34">
that I want is as I&#39;m walking to the forest on trying to now see the whole
</text>
<text start="1870.88" dur="3.9">
ecosystem and notice like what&#39;s new or what&#39;s different is actually one of my
</text>
<text start="1874.78" dur="5.04">
favorite things about the possibilities VR is I&#39;m very personally age in systems
</text>
<text start="1879.82" dur="4.11">
most of the game work I do is systems driven I&#39;ve defined systems very
</text>
<text start="1883.93" dur="3.48">
interesting and systems are super hard to understand one of the things is
</text>
<text start="1887.41" dur="4.41">
amazing about games is the games are actually they are the art form that is
</text>
<text start="1891.82" dur="4.89">
best at doing systemic metaphor you make systems that are metaphors for larger
</text>
<text start="1896.71" dur="3.69">
systems and we get that it&#39;s a simplified version the system and we can
</text>
<text start="1900.4" dur="4.02">
experiment with it and understand things about that larger system right so to
</text>
<text start="1904.42" dur="5.48">
your point how do I walk through the forest and have these like genuinely
</text>
<text start="1909.9" dur="5.89">
magical natural you know almost like beings without consciousness that are
</text>
<text start="1915.79" dur="4.95">
the systems that like operate the world that operate an ecosystem that make
</text>
<text start="1920.74" dur="4.8">
nature function that have that bird taking that fluff and making a nest and
</text>
<text start="1925.54" dur="4.77">
in that process they spread a seat yeah whatever right how do you give me
</text>
<text start="1930.31" dur="3.15">
beautiful metaphors for those systems while I am walking through them and
</text>
<text start="1933.46" dur="2.85">
embedding with them so that I can play with them and understand them in a
</text>
<text start="1936.31" dur="3.45">
consequence-free way right you can experiment with the system of nature on
</text>
<text start="1939.76" dur="4.35">
a hike by like taking a shotgun and shooting birds out of the sky but I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="1944.11" dur="3.9">
not particularly personally interested in that though some people are you know
</text>
<text start="1948.01" dur="3.39">
it&#39;s not what I want to do but I am really interested in it&#39;s like I would
</text>
<text start="1951.4" dur="3.42">
love to be like what would happen if like all these birds were gone right
</text>
<text start="1954.82" dur="4.02">
like is there a game I can make where I&#39;d go through the forest and I toss
</text>
<text start="1958.84" dur="3.93">
speculative futures at the forest and it responds by showing me the forest
</text>
<text start="1962.77" dur="2.8">
version of that future I mean I don&#39;t know how you do that but
</text>
<text start="1965.57" dur="3.96">
right like that sounds magical and amazing to me you know or like I&#39;ve
</text>
<text start="1969.53" dur="4.58">
loved the idea of somebody making ley lines you know ley lines are right
</text>
<text start="1974.11" dur="4.66">
magical lines of force that encircle our globe you know and if you come to a
</text>
<text start="1978.77" dur="2.76">
nexus point of ley lines that&#39;s where you can get real magical power together
</text>
<text start="1981.53" dur="2.88">
right like you could build the game experience about that where you filled
</text>
<text start="1984.41" dur="5.46">
the world with ley lines that you had chosen were driven by magnetic force or
</text>
<text start="1989.87" dur="4.98">
the arc of water through our planet or migration like you could define it any
</text>
<text start="1994.85" dur="4.38">
number of millions of ways and then use that to like highlight these systems
</text>
<text start="1999.23" dur="4.23">
that are making our world churn and you know I want to be able to like someday
</text>
<text start="2003.46" dur="4.65">
be take a hug give me like oh I&#39;m gonna hike out to that nexus point and then I
</text>
<text start="2008.11" dur="5.37">
want to summon a Phoenix or I don&#39;t know you know what I mean like and again this
</text>
<text start="2013.48" dur="3.54">
is just me and not everybody wants these things but I want them and I think that
</text>
<text start="2017.02" dur="3.9">
they&#39;re exploring space that is very interesting I think whether it&#39;s what I
</text>
<text start="2020.92" dur="4.65">
exactly said but like this idea that by augmented reality we can view and tap
</text>
<text start="2025.57" dur="4.41">
into and metaphor and understand the systems that are heavily operational
</text>
<text start="2029.98" dur="5.04">
around us all the time is really exciting and it reminds me if you
</text>
<text start="2035.02" dur="3.9">
haven&#39;t seen the game the game which isn&#39;t VR at all I just saw 800 percent
</text>
<text start="2038.92" dur="6.99">
that you immerse yourself inside a system that exists in bars and have to
</text>
<text start="2045.91" dur="4.62">
experience it and it&#39;s a simplified version of that system but it&#39;s like you
</text>
<text start="2050.53" dur="5.61">
start to see how this thing works in a way that you wouldn&#39;t if you were just
</text>
<text start="2056.14" dur="3.24">
there so yeah yeah I just had a chance to actually play that this morning it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2059.38" dur="4.68">
like a massive 400 page script of deducing all of the interactive tactics
</text>
<text start="2064.06" dur="4.5">
of the pickup artists scene and that you are a woman basically being confronted
</text>
<text start="2068.56" dur="2.91">
by all these men and so yeah I went through a number of different paths but
</text>
<text start="2071.47" dur="3.93">
it&#39;s fascinating and it was like just to see the psychology of what they were
</text>
<text start="2075.4" dur="4.11">
doing and to sort of break down and also to empathize like how gross it feels
</text>
<text start="2079.51" dur="7.29">
yeah I fully agree I&#39;m a big fan of that I&#39;m a big fan of all of our games great
</text>
<text start="2086.8" dur="4.379">
and and finally what do you think is the ultimate potential of virtual or
</text>
<text start="2091.179" dur="4.19">
augmented reality or games in general and what they might be able to any
</text>
<text start="2095.369" dur="3.541">
but I think a lot of it actually goes back to what I just said I mean I think
</text>
<text start="2098.91" dur="7.099">
that gains are the best way of helping people understand systems and I think
</text>
<text start="2106.009" dur="4.99">
our world has always been made up of systems but we have been making a lot of
</text>
<text start="2110.999" dur="6.06">
systems on top of it for a long time without a lot of necessarily like look
</text>
<text start="2117.059" dur="3.901">
at what all the systems are and I genuinely believe that like the future
</text>
<text start="2120.96" dur="4.859">
of games is partially about making the whole world more systems literate
</text>
<text start="2125.819" dur="3.72">
letting us play with them and experiment them and understand that they are there
</text>
<text start="2129.539" dur="4.02">
and a little bit more about what they&#39;re doing and how they&#39;re doing and then for
</text>
<text start="2133.559" dur="4.381">
me on a technological level the possibility of vrn AR is everything I
</text>
<text start="2137.94" dur="7.319">
want but it is all AR I want to be back to being embodied in a real physical
</text>
<text start="2145.259" dur="5.161">
world paying attention to it and spending time with it and I don&#39;t want
</text>
<text start="2150.42" dur="7.74">
to give up the wealth of knowledge and communication ability and augment
</text>
<text start="2158.16" dur="4.109">
ability and things that exist in this computer that I carry in my pocket
</text>
<text start="2162.269" dur="3.661">
everywhere I want to be able to access that knowledge when I need to I want to
</text>
<text start="2165.93" dur="4.71">
be able to reach back into that human cultural system and talk to someone
</text>
<text start="2170.64" dur="3.78">
about what&#39;s happening out here and I just want them to be as seamless as
</text>
<text start="2174.42" dur="4.23">
possible that&#39;s the technology future I look for many people want the holodeck
</text>
<text start="2178.65" dur="9">
I&#39;m Supes not interested I want to be in the world and having the glory that is
</text>
<text start="2187.65" dur="3.57">
so many of the good things that we&#39;ve developed over the past 1,000 years as
</text>
<text start="2191.22" dur="4.68">
humankind anything else that&#39;s left unsaid that you&#39;d like to say to either
</text>
<text start="2195.9" dur="3.629">
the gaming or immersive community you know I think I said most of it mostly
</text>
<text start="2199.529" dur="5.09">
just make wonderful things make wonderful things make wonderful things
</text>
<text start="2204.619" dur="3.011">great thank you so much thank you very much</text>
<text start="2207.63" dur="4.77">
so that was Sam Roberts he&#39;s the festival director of IndieCade so have a
</text>
<text start="2212.4" dur="4.02">
number different takeaways about this interview is that first of all so it was
</text>
<text start="2216.42" dur="4.26">
interesting to hear Sam actually talk about augmented reality and what he
</text>
<text start="2220.68" dur="3.24">
wanted to play an augmented reality and that&#39;s one of the reasons why I wanted
</text>
<text start="2223.92" dur="4.56">
to put this interview out now is just because this idea that you
</text>
<text start="2228.48" dur="4.95">
use augmented reality and to be able to change the context of a meaning of a
</text>
<text start="2233.43" dur="4.26">
physical space and so one of the trends that Sam identified was games that are
</text>
<text start="2237.69" dur="3.15">
embedded into spaces now they had different games where you had to
</text>
<text start="2240.84" dur="2.97">
actually physically be there you&#39;re blindfolded you&#39;re having other people
</text>
<text start="2243.81" dur="3.48">
with direct your around there&#39;s a really fun game that I played that was called
</text>
<text start="2247.29" dur="4.89">
laser maser which it&#39;s a iPhone game where you can play either on a phone or
</text>
<text start="2252.18" dur="4.86">
a tablet and you&#39;re essentially walking through space and it&#39;s using all the
</text>
<text start="2257.04" dur="4.02">
augmented reality features to be able to detect a volume of where you&#39;re at and
</text>
<text start="2261.06" dur="3.78">
it allows you to walk through this virtual world that you&#39;re seeing through
</text>
<text start="2264.84" dur="4.11">
this window this portal of the augmentation but you can play it in a
</text>
<text start="2268.95" dur="2.97">
small confined space and as you&#39;re walking around you can pause and move
</text>
<text start="2271.92" dur="3.87">
around and try to have a game within a game as you&#39;re walking around you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="2275.79" dur="3.63">
trying to navigate a space that&#39;s constrained but you could also play it
</text>
<text start="2279.42" dur="3.57">
in this huge open field out in like a park and so it&#39;s a game that&#39;s designed
</text>
<text start="2282.99" dur="3.66">
for you to be out in nature and to be able to use that full space to local
</text>
<text start="2286.65" dur="3.75">
mode around so this is some of the trends that he&#39;s starting to see if ways
</text>
<text start="2290.4" dur="4.02">
that you can start to be connected to the environment around yourself and one
</text>
<text start="2294.42" dur="2.55">
of the games that he wanted to see was just you know walking through a forest
</text>
<text start="2296.97" dur="5.01">
and having this mythopoetic fantasy that&#39;s laid on top of the world around
</text>
<text start="2301.98" dur="3.54">
him and that part of the reason why he wants to do that is as you start to
</text>
<text start="2305.52" dur="3.33">
augment and change your world you start to notice and pay attention to what is
</text>
<text start="2308.85" dur="3.9">
already there and so you&#39;re adding this augmentation this new layer of meaning
</text>
<text start="2312.75" dur="3.72">
but as you create that new layer meaning it actually allows you to juxtapose that
</text>
<text start="2316.47" dur="3.57">
layer of meaning with what the meaning that is already there and just the
</text>
<text start="2320.04" dur="2.52">
process of doing that changes the meaning of the world around you and I
</text>
<text start="2322.56" dur="3.09">
think this is probably one of the most profound implications of augmented
</text>
<text start="2325.65" dur="3.75">
reality that we have is that we&#39;re gonna be able to start to layer stories and
</text>
<text start="2329.4" dur="4.92">
games on top of these systems that are going to maybe give us access to be able
</text>
<text start="2334.32" dur="3.39">
to have this interacted with playable experience that allows us to have this
</text>
<text start="2337.71" dur="4.38">
systemic metaphor for what that system even is we&#39;re gonna be able to take the
</text>
<text start="2342.09" dur="4.56">
macrocosm and have a very small microcosm interaction that is trying to
</text>
<text start="2346.65" dur="4.17">
in some ways reflect the larger ecosystem of what that metaphor is
</text>
<text start="2350.82" dur="3.81">
talking about I think a good example of that was the game called the game which
</text>
<text start="2354.63" dur="4.86">
is essentially a gamification of a lot of the pickup artist techniques and it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2359.49" dur="2.73">
an interactive dialogue and so as you&#39;re going through it&#39;s a
</text>
<text start="2362.22" dur="2.76">
bit of like from the game perspective you&#39;re trying to make a prediction as to
</text>
<text start="2364.98" dur="4.11">
what&#39;s gonna happen based upon what you are saying and there&#39;s a lot of things
</text>
<text start="2369.09" dur="4.08">
that are kind of intuitive and it&#39;s also giving you an experience of what it
</text>
<text start="2373.17" dur="3.75">
might feel like to go out and to try to hang out with your friend and you are
</text>
<text start="2376.92" dur="4.02">
bashed by line after line of these men who are doing these different techniques
</text>
<text start="2380.94" dur="3.27">
and in some ways by playing the game you start to understand what those
</text>
<text start="2384.21" dur="3.21">
techniques are so you can start to understand the larger trajectory of what
</text>
<text start="2387.42" dur="3.689">
they&#39;re doing both as a defense to be able to you know be able to handle it
</text>
<text start="2391.109" dur="3.651">
but also just trying to unlock these different aspects of human psychology
</text>
<text start="2394.76" dur="3.82">
it&#39;s a really interesting game and I think that there&#39;s actually a lot of
</text>
<text start="2398.58" dur="3.6">
buzz about it but I think it&#39;s something that what Sam was saying trying to
</text>
<text start="2402.18" dur="4.86">
represent something that is an entire complex interactive system that really
</text>
<text start="2407.04" dur="3.12">
has all these rules and and how you navigate it and by doing this
</text>
<text start="2410.16" dur="4.14">
interactive narrative through it it&#39;s like this 400 page script and many
</text>
<text start="2414.3" dur="3.93">
different endings you get a sense of trying to explore this possibility space
</text>
<text start="2418.23" dur="4.98">
of these different philosophies of seduction but that is just an example of
</text>
<text start="2423.21" dur="3.84">
trying to take something that is a complex interactive system and trying to
</text>
<text start="2427.05" dur="3.51">
break it down in a way that you can translate it into a game and so that I
</text>
<text start="2430.56" dur="4.559">
think is what I found some of the most profound implications of what gaming as
</text>
<text start="2435.119" dur="4.051">
a communication medium can do is to take these really complex systems to break
</text>
<text start="2439.17" dur="3.6">
them down into these component parts that are interactive but are trying to
</text>
<text start="2442.77" dur="4.079">
as you play them you start to get a sense of the larger ecosystem and I I
</text>
<text start="2446.849" dur="4.02">
did actually have a chance to play the interactive auction game and it was
</text>
<text start="2450.869" dur="4.321">
fascinating to be able to play it and to be able to see what I learned about what
</text>
<text start="2455.19" dur="4.2">
it means to be in an auction and yeah there&#39;s a social dimension to the game
</text>
<text start="2459.39" dur="3.42">
and for anybody who has a chance to play it you start to learn about these
</text>
<text start="2462.81" dur="3.27">
systems like I feel like I have an experience of what it means to be in an
</text>
<text start="2466.08" dur="3.539">
auction now even though I&#39;ll probably never actually be in an auction but like
</text>
<text start="2469.619" dur="4.021">
Sam said that game gave me this access point to be able to have this embodied
</text>
<text start="2473.64" dur="3">
experience of something that is a bit of a social dynamic that can happen within
</text>
<text start="2476.64" dur="4.38">
these auctions so it was also just interesting to hear from Sam about the
</text>
<text start="2481.02" dur="3.569">
different genres of games and the evolution of games some of the different
</text>
<text start="2484.589" dur="4.651">
trends that he&#39;s seeing and trying to find new multimodal inputs to games but
</text>
<text start="2489.24" dur="3.33">
now at this point it&#39;s about how to integrate multiple angles for how to
</text>
<text start="2492.57" dur="3.39">
attack a game and how can you combine all these things into a scene
</text>
<text start="2495.96" dur="4.74">
experience and so some of these radio plays had to chance to watch some of
</text>
<text start="2500.7" dur="3.75">
that radio play that was there at IndieCade and talk to the creators and
</text>
<text start="2504.45" dur="2.669">
they were like yeah this is a game that we could start to put on to like the
</text>
<text start="2507.119" dur="4.141">
Amazon echo or the Google home and you have this interactive conversational
</text>
<text start="2511.26" dur="3.45">
interface that is taking something that is a story and a narrative but you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="2514.71" dur="3.36">
able to participate in that and be able to interact with it and change the
</text>
<text start="2518.07" dur="2.91">
direction of this branching path and narrative there was a number of
</text>
<text start="2520.98" dur="3.6">
different VR experiences that I had a chance to go through and I did a few
</text>
<text start="2524.58" dur="2.91">
interviews with some of the creators as well so I&#39;ll be talking to the creator
</text>
<text start="2527.49" dur="4.2">
of phenomenology as well as the everybody sad experiences but that
</text>
<text start="2531.69" dur="4.89">
overall Sam is really focusing on the interaction paradigm it&#39;s a play
</text>
<text start="2536.58" dur="3.84">
Festival for play experiences so he&#39;s really thinking about what do I do what
</text>
<text start="2540.42" dur="3.81">
happens when I do it and how do I do it so he&#39;s really focusing on that active
</text>
<text start="2544.23" dur="4.71">
presence and expressing her agency and making choices taking action but there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2548.94" dur="4.11">
also this new dimension of the embodied presence the environmental presence the
</text>
<text start="2553.05" dur="3.99">
emotional presence and storytelling and how to balance those two things I think
</text>
<text start="2557.04" dur="4.26">
is one of the challenges of game design is to do this balance between the
</text>
<text start="2561.3" dur="5.039">
generative control of the player either through procedurally generated content
</text>
<text start="2566.339" dur="4.26">
that is a little bit random in some ways but are different every time but also
</text>
<text start="2570.599" dur="4.141">
this authorial control of the creator of the game to be able to have a fixed
</text>
<text start="2574.74" dur="3.27">
narrative and having that balance between authorial control and the
</text>
<text start="2578.01" dur="4.05">
journey of control of the player to be able to explore around and so that
</text>
<text start="2582.06" dur="3.779">
balance between the young and the end of what is going to be received by the user
</text>
<text start="2585.839" dur="4.5">
and what ability and agency does the the player and the user have to be able to
</text>
<text start="2590.339" dur="3.541">
actually determine their own destiny within the experience and just going
</text>
<text start="2593.88" dur="3.63">
back to the transformative power of the Magic Circle the Magic Circle is
</text>
<text start="2597.51" dur="3.87">
essentially like a set of rules that you are saying that this has a deeper
</text>
<text start="2601.38" dur="3.3">
meaning just as an example if you look at soccer you are essentially just
</text>
<text start="2604.68" dur="3.87">
kicking a ball into a net but the meaning that happens when you&#39;re able to
</text>
<text start="2608.55" dur="4.319">
actually do that it takes on much larger significance of this competition in the
</text>
<text start="2612.869" dur="3.931">
context of that competition that goes way beyond the mundane act of a ball
</text>
<text start="2616.8" dur="4.59">
going into a net it&#39;s a goal and it&#39;s in the context of a game so with that magic
</text>
<text start="2621.39" dur="4.62">
circle that magic circle has the power to literally reshape the world around us
</text>
<text start="2626.01" dur="4.89">
to having different layers of meaning that means something more than what it
</text>
<text start="2630.9" dur="4.439">
means just what our mundane meaning that we have ascribe to it and so as we add
</text>
<text start="2635.339" dur="3.541">
more and more layers of meaning and purpose then is going to recontextualize
</text>
<text start="2638.88" dur="3.27">
the original meaning take on a completely new meeting after that and I
</text>
<text start="2642.15" dur="2.849">
think that&#39;s the thing it&#39;s just changing our relationship to the world
</text>
<text start="2644.999" dur="4.381">
around us and it&#39;s changing the way that we are able to see the world and finally
</text>
<text start="2649.38" dur="3.51">
you know Sam said that the future of entertainment is headed towards this
</text>
<text start="2652.89" dur="5.01">
experience all bespoke and immersive experiences where people want to change
</text>
<text start="2657.9" dur="2.55">
the world around them and to make it feel different they want to have it
</text>
<text start="2660.45" dur="3.299">
experience and not just a story but they want to have something that&#39;s theirs
</text>
<text start="2663.749" dur="3.181">
they want to have these immersive and interactive experiences and I think that
</text>
<text start="2666.93" dur="3.689">
both the augmented and virtual reality all these conversational interfaces
</text>
<text start="2670.619" dur="5.311">
ambient interfaces multimodal input with transmedia types of experiences that are
</text>
<text start="2675.93" dur="4.47">
either by yourself or with other people but it&#39;s able to have these shared
</text>
<text start="2680.4" dur="3.359">
experiences that are not just something that you&#39;re passively consuming but
</text>
<text start="2683.759" dur="3.3">
something that you&#39;re actively interacting with and that they want to
</text>
<text start="2687.059" dur="4.111">
have a lived experience that is theirs that is very unique to them and that
</text>
<text start="2691.17" dur="2.849">
they&#39;re able to tell the story of their own experience and so they want
</text>
<text start="2694.019" dur="3.901">
immersive interactive bespoke experiences and that they&#39;re able to
</text>
<text start="2697.92" dur="3.72">
actually participate and interact with and that the future of play is going to
</text>
<text start="2701.64" dur="4.469">
be immersive social interactive experiences to allow you to understand
</text>
<text start="2706.109" dur="3.96">
these complex systems and these games are systemic metaphors to allow you to
</text>
<text start="2710.069" dur="3.78">
have a small experience that allows you to have a greater understanding of the
</text>
<text start="2713.849" dur="5.071">
